Each processor uses more RAM, and on a workstation with many processors, you can sometimes get better performance by reducing `num_processors_to_use`. Unfortunately, this is a bit of an art form, so the best way to determine the optimal number is by trial and error. When you set `num_processors_to_use` variable to `None`, it defaults to *one* less than the total number of CPU cores available (the reason we don't automatically set it to the total number of cores is because in practice this almost universally leads to worse performance). Also, while you can set `num_processors_to_use` to a number greater than the available number of CPU cores, we <b>do not</b> recommend it for performance reasons.\n",

While you can sometimes get away with less, we recommend a *bare minimum* level of 16GB of RAM, but more is better. 32GB RAM is acceptable, 64GB is good, 128GB is great.

It also determines the value of `gSiz`, which is set to `2*gSig + 1` for CNMF. `gSiz` is the width of a bounding box created around each seed pixel during initilialization -- if after running `refit()` below your neurons end up looking square or artificially cut off, you may need to increase `gSiz`.\n",

More information on these choices can be found [here](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn/blob/master/docs/CLUSTER.md). You can set the number of processes (cpu cores) to use with the `n_processes` variable: the default value `None` will lead to the function selecting one *less* than the total number of logical cores available.  \n",

        "The parameter `ignore_preexisting`, which defaults to `False`, is a failsafe used to avoid overwhelming your resources. If you try to start another cluster, you will get an error. However, sometimes on more powerful machines may want to spin up multiple Caiman environments. In that case, set `ignore_preexisting` to `True` and you will not get an error.\n",

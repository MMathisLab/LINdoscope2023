# behavior analysis lab

Behavior analysis: Data from the behavioural experiments will be analyzed in detail by including a main demonstration led by the instructor and students following along with self-coded scripts throughout the analysis pipeline. Students will be introduced to two main methods for behavioural analysis, the use of DeepLabCut for analysis of the motion of the head-fixed animal (1 hour) and the use of VAME (Luxem et al, 2021) for detailed behavioural analysis (1 hour). An online introductory lecture to both methods will also be provided in advance, which the students are asked to watch prior to the session. The session then starts with a Q&A part on the introductory material, which is directly followed by the hands-on part (2 hours). Students will be provided a pre-installed virtual environment in preparation before the course commences. If students want to work on their own data, they have to hand it in to the TAs one day previously to carry out the training of the models, otherwise demo data will be provided. During the hands-on assignments, students will learn how to quantify behavior and moreover correlate it with neural population activity. All code produced from the instructors and students will also be available to the students offline and after the course ends via the course website. 

# Learning objectives:
